While opening the gitbash we need to setup  the name and email using git config command.

1) clone - cloning a repo in our local machine
    git clone link_of_the_file

2) status - display the status of the code
    git status

    we can have 4 types of status.
    untracked - new file that git doesnt yet tracked 
    modified - changed
    staged - file is ready to be commited
    unmodified - unchanged

3) add - add new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area.
        git add file_name 

4)commit - record of the changes.
        git commit -m "some message"
